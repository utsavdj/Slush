          <h1>What is<br /><span>SLUSH ?</span></h1>
          <p>SLUSH is Europe’s leading startup and technology event, which connects startups and tech talent with top-tier international investors, executives, and media. In 2015, SLUSH brought together 15,000 attendees including 1,700 startups, 800 venture capital investors and 630 journalists from exactly 100 countries for the two day event held in Helsinki, Finland. People from more than half of the world’s countries traveled to Helsinki, with the ambition of taking their business to the next level.</p>
          <p>SLUSH is a non-profit event organized by a community of entrepreneurs, investors, students and festival organizers. Although SLUSH has grown from a 300-person event to become one of the leading events of its kind in the world, the philosophy behind it has remained the same: to help the next generation of great, world-conquering companies forward.

        <h1>What is<br /><span>GLOBAL IMPACT ACCELERATOR?</span></h1>   
        <p>SLUSH Global Impact Accelerator (GIA) is a program created in collaboration with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland and multiple partners globally. The purpose is to create a leading global program to support startups that are looking to solve some of the most pressing global challenges and contributing to the discussion on impact investing.</p>
        <p>SLUSH Global Impact Accelerator 2016 brings impactful entrepreneurs from emerging markets to Helsinki to accelerate their business, attract additional financing and make an even greater impact on their societies and beyond. The program includes online pre-event coaching and Helsinki boot camp program from November 22–December 2, 2016 culminating in SLUSH.</p>

        <h1>Why<br /><span>SLUSH IN NEPAL?</span></h1>         
        <p>SLUSH acts as a bridge between startups and investors, media and executives. Nepal, now more than ever, is excited about the prospects of booming business that are centered around technology. We have seen instances around the world where technology form the core of business, and successfully so. Lately, Nepal also has shown exciting prospects in this area.</p>
        <p>We have start ups and we have established companies with innovative products that are not just nationally significant but also have international prospects. Right now, an opportunity to take these products to international investors is not just less, but nonexistent. SLUSH Nepal could be a pioneer in taking Nepalese products to an important international platform of a huge scale such as SLUSH. YoungInnovations as convener of mobile social networking hub (<span class="red"><a href="http://www.mobilenepal.net/" target="_blank">www.mobilenepal.net</a></span>) is proud to bring this event in Nepal.</p>
